https://mars-io.vercel.app/

## Overview
**Mars IO** is an AI-powered system designed to recommend anime based on a user's current mental state. In a world full of emotional ups and downs, Mars IO acts as a supportive tool, suggesting anime that resonates with your feelings, reduces stress, and boosts motivation.

## Why Mars IO?
Modern users often face emotional struggles like depression, anxiety, or loneliness—and don't always have someone to talk to. Mars IO fills that gap with AI that understands mentality and uses **anime** as a form of comfort, expression, and healing.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Suggestions**: The system maps emotional states to relevant anime themes.
- **Powered by Gemini API**: For advanced NLP understanding.
- **Built with React JS**: For a fast and interactive UI.
- **Future-Ready**: Scope to suggest motivational books and study guides.

## Sample Anime Recommendations
- Feeling lost? → *Naruto*
- Angry or frustrated? → *Attack on Titan*
- Need motivation? → *My Hero Academia*
- Want to cry it out? → *Your Lie in April*
- Seeking peace? → *Spirited Away*

## Tech Stack
- React JS (Frontend)
- Gemini API (Natural Language Understanding)
- Python (for backend logic - optional)
